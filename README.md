# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Based on Multi-Channel Campaign Engagement

## Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of multi-channel marketing campaigns in predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).  The analysis aims to identify high-CLTV customer segments based on their engagement patterns across various channels (e.g., email, social media, SMS).  By understanding these patterns, businesses can optimize resource allocation, improve marketing ROI, and target high-value customers more effectively.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE), and insights into high-CLTV customer segments.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., `cltv_distribution.png`, `campaign_engagement.png`) which are saved in the project directory. These visualizations illustrate the distribution of CLTV, campaign engagement patterns, and the relationship between engagement and CLTV.  The specific output will depend on the dataset used.


## Data

The project requires a dataset containing customer information, including their engagement with various marketing channels and their historical purchase data (to calculate CLTV).  Please ensure that you have the necessary data file in the correct location as specified within the `main.py` script.  For testing purposes, a sample dataset can be provided upon request.
